# C++ Learning Journey

Welcome to my C++ learning repository! 🚀

This repository documents my journey of learning and mastering C++. I am continuously improving my knowledge of data structures, algorithms, and key programming concepts using C++. The goal is to practice and apply my understanding through hands-on coding, problem-solving, and building projects.

## 📚 Topics Covered

- **Basic Syntax & Programming Fundamentals**
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts**
- **Data Structures (Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs)**
- **Algorithms (Sorting, Searching, Recursion, Dynamic Programming)**
- **Memory Management & Pointers**
- **File Handling**
- **STL (Standard Template Library)**
- **Multithreading & Concurrency**

## 🚀 Progress

- Daily coding challenges and problems from platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, and Codeforces.
- Step-by-step explanations for important concepts.
- Project-based learning, implementing small projects and tools with C++.

## 🛠️ Tools and Resources

- **IDE**: Visual Studio Code / Code::Blocks / CLion
- **Compiler**: GCC / MinGW
- **Platforms**: LeetCode, HackerRank, Codeforces

## 🔥 Future Goals

- Contribute to open-source C++ projects.
- Build more complex C++ projects.
- Master advanced concepts like STL, Templates, and Networking.
